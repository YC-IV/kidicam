## Motivation

The size of grip is also smaller and specially designed for younger kids. My 4+ year-old kid can easily and stably hold the phone.

## Usage

### Take photos and share ideas
Let you kids take photos and share the things intertest them and know how to describe them.

### Learn the new things
When kids are wondering what the things are, like names or pronunciations, they can use Google Lens to take photos and then get all the information immediately.

## 3D model
The whole frame consists of two parts: the main part (the grip and shutter socket) [[link]](/model/zenfone8_cameraCase_v1p2-Body_right_handler.stl) and the lower part [[link]](/model/zenfone8_cameraCase_v1p2-Body_left_frame.stl).

## Hardware and accessories
The 3D model is based on Asus Zenfone 8. And also needs the following accessories:
+ Bluetooth remote shutter: a stock Bluetooth shutter for mobile phone [[link]](https://www.momoshop.com.tw/TP/TP0001385/goodsDetail/TP00013850000727?categoryCode=4200700384&sourcePageType=4).
+ A steel ruler: the project uses a 15cm stainless steel ruler as a pin. The length, width and thickness are 16.5 mm, 13.5 mm and 0.65 cm respectively. This ruler aligns the main and lower parts and enforces the overall rigidness.
+ Screws: 5 round head screws. The diameter of head is 5 mm, and the diameter and length of the thread part are 3 mm and 11 mm respectively.
