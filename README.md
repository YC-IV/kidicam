## 🎯 Motivation
The KidiCam project aims to provide children with a tool that is both educational and fun. The custom-designed grip is tailored for small hands, ensuring that even a 4-year-old can hold the camera comfortably and securely.

## 🚀 Features
* Capture & Share: Empower kids to take photos of their surroundings and share their perspectives.
* Interactive Learning: Utilize Google Lens to identify objects, learn names, pronunciations, and gather information instantly.
* Creative Expression: Encourage storytelling and description skills as children explain their photographs.

## 🛠️ Hardware and Accessories
The 3D model is designed around the Asus Zenfone 8. And also needs the following accessories:
* Bluetooth remote shutter: a stock Bluetooth shutter for mobile phone [[Specs]](https://www.momoshop.com.tw/TP/TP0001385/goodsDetail/TP00013850000727?categoryCode=4200700384&sourcePageType=4).
* A steel ruler: the project uses a 15cm stainless steel ruler as a pin. The length, width and thickness are 16.5 mm, 13.5 mm and 0.65 cm respectively. This ruler aligns the main and lower parts and enforces the overall rigidness.
* Screws: 5 round head screws. The diameter of head is 5 mm, and the diameter and length of the thread part are 3 mm and 11 mm respectively.

## 📁 3D Model
The whole frame consists of two parts:
* The main part (the grip and shutter socket) [[Download STL]](/model/zenfone8_cameraCase_v1p2-Body_right_handler.stl)
* The lower part [[Download STL]](/model/zenfone8_cameraCase_v1p2-Body_left_frame.stl)
